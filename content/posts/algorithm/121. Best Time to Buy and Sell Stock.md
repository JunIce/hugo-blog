# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock



## 题目

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return *the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction*. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

 

### 解答

```typescript
function maxProfit(prices: number[]): number {
  let left = 0;
  let right = 1;
  let max_profit = 0;

  while (right < prices.length) {
    if (prices[left] < prices[right]) {
      let profit = prices[right] - prices[left];
      max_profit = Math.max(max_profit, profit);
    } else {
      left = right;
    }

    right++;
  }

  return max_profit;
}
```



```typescript
function maxProfit(prices: number[]): number {
    let min = prices[0];
    let max_profit = 0;

    for(let i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
        max_profit = Math.max(prices[i] - min, max_profit)
        min = Math.min(min, prices[i])
    }

    return max_profit;
}
```
